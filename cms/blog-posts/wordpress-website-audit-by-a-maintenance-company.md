  But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure
  and praising pain was born and I will give you.

Maintaining a Website
---------------------

Website maintenance is no easy task, and it’s not something you want to scrimp on. Website maintenance requires regular checkups, treating your website like an expensive car or a child, whatever you’re willing to pay more attention to.

We emphasize being regular because if your website is down or your users are encountering bugs, it doesn’t bode well for your brand image or web traffic. Users might click off and decide against coming back another time. First impressions are often the last impressions with internet users; we’re not exactly known for our attention spans!

Long story short, website maintenance is crucial to retaining a steady flow of web traffic and lead generation online. Brands often tend to overlook website maintenance after the initial completion. This is partly because business owners simply don’t know what to look for and their webmasters’ focus is shifted to driving leads and conversions instead.

The good news is that you don’t have to do it yourself, like most things these days, you can hire someone to [**improve your website performance**](https://upqode.com/wordpress-maintenance-services/) for you.

What is a Website Audit?
------------------------

A website audit is a thorough analysis of your website in terms of visibility as well as ease of navigation. There are three main types of website audits that are conducted, typically in tandem with one another. Here’s a quick breakdown!

### 1\. Technical Audit

The [**technical audit**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2021/11/02/how-technical-audits-can-fix-your-websites-ranking-performance/) of your website assesses the technical aspects of your website, this pertains to what we discussed earlier; speed, security, etc.

Technical audits also look for anything your site may be missing that keeps it from fulfilling search engine requirements. Search engines only crawl websites that meet their requirements, and only websites that get crawled get ranked.

For example, if your site doesn’t have an XML sitemap, a search engine is unlikely to waste its crawl budget on your website. A technical audit combs through the technical qualities of your website and devises ways for you to fix them.
